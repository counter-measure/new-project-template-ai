# TEST Product Requirements Document: Data MCP Slack Bot

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Product Overview
The Data MCP Slack Bot is an internal tool designed to enable staff members to query company data through natural language conversations in Slack. The bot leverages Claude AI and the Metabase MCP (Model Context Protocol) to translate user questions into SQL queries and return data-driven answers directly in Slack channels.

### 1.2 Business Objectives
- **Primary Goal**: Democratize data access across the organization by enabling non-technical staff to query company data through natural language
- **Secondary Goals**: 
  - Reduce dependency on data analysts for simple queries
  - Increase data-driven decision making across teams
  - Improve response time for data questions
  - Provide consistent data access interface

### 1.3 Success Metrics
- User adoption rate (target: 80% of staff within 3 months)
- Query response time (target: <30 seconds)
- Query accuracy rate (target: >95%)
- Reduction in manual data requests to data team (target: 50% reduction)

- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Provide alternative responses when primary services are unavailable
- **Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of bot performance and health

## 3. User Stories

### 3.1 Primary User Stories
1. **As a staff member**, I want to ask data questions in natural language so that I can get insights without learning SQL
2. **As a manager**, I want to quickly check team metrics so that I can make informed decisions
3. **As a data analyst**, I want to reduce repetitive simple queries so that I can focus on complex analysis
4. **As an IT administrator**, I want to ensure secure data access so that company data remains protected

### 3.2 Acceptance Criteria
- Users can successfully execute queries using the `/data` command
- Bot responds with accurate data within 30 seconds
- Bot provides helpful error messages for invalid queries
- Bot respects user permissions and data access rights
- All queries are logged for audit purposes

## 4. Technical Constraints
