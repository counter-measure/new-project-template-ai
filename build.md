# Implementing the Linear Issues

Use the Linear project specified in project_metadata.json as the source of truth for issues including description and issue status.

## Task Tracking
1. Get all tasks and their statuses from Linear project specified in project_metadata.json using the linear MCP
2. Follow the Approach section below to implement the code 
3. Once the feature is working update the linear issue status to 4 "In review"
4. Move onto the next task


## Approach 
To implement the issues follow a test driven development approach.

1. Write tests for each issue that will initially fail
2. Write methods to satisfy each issue
3. Rerun tests to see if they pass
4. Iterate and refine the methods until the tests pass
